# Design Patterns

- Composite Pattern: Creates a hierarchical structure of objects, treating individual objects and compositions uniformly.

- Decorator Pattern: Dynamically adds additional responsibilities to objects without affecting other instances of the same class.

- Factory Pattern: Provides an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to decide the class to instantiate.

- Observer Pattern: Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, triggering updates in dependents when changes occur.

- Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

These design patterns enhance modularity, flexibility, and extensibility in the project. Refer to the codebase for more details on their implementation.
